MFC-Based Project Highlighting Topics Covered This Semester

Program Requirements
- Button to do the "magic" - this performs a mod-10 check digit calculation against the supplied product number. If valid, display the product number and current inventory, otherwise, present a message box.
- Main branch performs the mod-10 calcuation using a simple loop.
- Branch 1 breaks the mod-10 check digit into multiple functions in an attempt at adding "jump obfuscation" to the code.
- Branch 2 checks for the presence of a debugger. If found, use the more "exotic" calculation, otherwise, call the default/simpler logic to perform the mod-10 calcuation.
