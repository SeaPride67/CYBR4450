MFC-Based Project Highlighting Topics Covered This Semester

Program Requirements
- Button to do the "magic"
- Simple routine that performs the magic, call this one when IsDebuggerPresent returns FALSE
- More complicated routine that does the same magic but causes jumps, call this one when IsDebuggerPresent returns TRUE
  - Switch/case
  - Functions calls
  
Maybe find a free code packer, pack the source, and show the differences using IdaPro
